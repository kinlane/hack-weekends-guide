If you are a developer please come and invite others to come as well - web front-end devs (JS\/HTML\/CSS\/etc), back-end programmers (Ruby\/Python\/Java\/ASP.net\/etc), desktop application programmers (C#, C++, C\/etc), etc.<\/p>\n<p><em>This hackathon will benefit<\/em>: Devs who have a current problem or Devs who would love to help other Devs out who need programming help. Also if youve ever wanted to learn a new APi, feel free to form a group surrounding one.<\/p>\n<p><em>This hackathon is also for<\/em>: meeting new devs, trying out languages\/patterns\/skills you wouldnt have normally tried before, and is perfect for the intermediate dev.<\/p>\n<p><em>This hackathon is not for:<\/em> business\/PR\/communications\/marketing people, anyone who doesnt work in code on a daily basis. Youre all great people, but this is for devs only.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please note in the comments sections of registration if you are here to help or to work on a programming problem.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>self.dev Hackathon Goal: Developers at all skill sets face problems each day that may become a road block and its likely other developers have hit similar obstacles and can be a great source of information. Join us for pair programming and group hacking to increase your skill set and knowledge.<\/p>","start_date":"Sep 14 2012 17:00:00","display_start_date":"09-14-2012","end_date":"Sep 15 2012 00:00:00","display_end_date":"09-14-2012","url":"http:\/\/selfdev-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"112 E Pecan St","city":"San Antonio","state":"TX","zip":"78205","country":"United States"}]}
