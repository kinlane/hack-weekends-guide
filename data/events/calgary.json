{"events":[{"name":"Calgary Startup Weekend 2\/12","about":"<p>Startup Weekends are 54-hour events designed to provide superior experiential education for technical and non-technical entrepreneurs.  Beginning with Friday night pitches and continuing through brainstorming, business plan development, and basic prototype creation, Startup Weekends culminate in Sunday night demos and presentations.  Participants create working startups during the event and are able to collaborate with like-minded individuals outside of their daily networks. All teams hear talks by industry leaders and receive valuable feedback from local entrepreneurials. The weekend is centered around action, innovation, and education.  Whether you are looking for feedback on a idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, Startup Weekends are the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.<\/p>","start_date":"Feb 04 2012 02:00:00","display_start_date":"02-03-2012","end_date":"Feb 06 2012 05:00:00","display_end_date":"02-05-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/event\/2427737428","address":"200, 1212 9th Ave SE","city":"Calgary","state":"","zip":"T2G0T1","country":"Canada"},{"name":"Calgary Hackathon 2","about":"<P CLASS=MsoNormal><SPAN STYLE=font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;>Hackathon:\u00a0an event when\u00a0<A TITLE=Programmer HREF=http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Programmer><SPAN STYLE=color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;>programmers<\/SPAN><\/A>\u00a0meet to do\u00a0<A TITLE=Collaborative software development model HREF=http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Collaborative_software_development_model><SPAN STYLE=color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;>collaborative<\/SPAN><\/A>\u00a0<A TITLE=Computer programming HREF=http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_programming><SPAN STYLE=color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;>computer programming<\/SPAN><\/A>.
